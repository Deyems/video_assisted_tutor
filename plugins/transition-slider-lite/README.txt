= What our users say =

<blockquote>"The support is amazing, this plugin is amazing. I would definitely recommend this plugin to everybody on wordpress. One of the easiest plugin to use and amazing capabilities." - oesalazar123</blockquote>
<blockquote>"Boom its a WOW! Plugin. quick & lovely support, completely satisfied." - agentkiller007</blockquote>
<blockquote>"I have used the lite version on two websites. Extremely user-friendly (important consideration for clients) and lightweight plugin. Superb all round." - alexwent</blockquote>
<blockquote>"The free plugin version of Transition Slider is already feature-rich packed so that you can test out any settings needed. It has more options available for free than I have seen at a different similar slider. Beyond that, it is even easier to use. The only caveat is that the free version is not having settings for mobile devices and I highly recommend purchasing the full version to get all features including fine-grained settings for mobile devices. The pricing is very fair and combating with other plugins that are less feature-rich, less easy to use, and much more expensive." - yogieanamcara</blockquote>
<blockquote>"It’s a very fine slider with great effects – thanks!" - glaeskewpr</blockquote>
<blockquote>"This slider is loaded with features, and is easy to get going. And the support is absolutely phenomenal!" - stevemullen</blockquote>
<blockquote>"The makers are very responsive and helped me with an issue I was having. Which resulted in a new update that made this slider plugin one of the best out there!" - bluesblue1</blockquote>
